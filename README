The salt-keystore is currently limited to be in the filesystem.
Running multiple masters requires some sort of shared storage
(nfs, etc.) to be able to share the keystore as well as the masters
cache. 

Pluggable external keystores like redis, couchdb or mysql would
be a great addition to salt and would open up other possibilites
as well. For example one could store the last time a minion has
authenticated on each authentication or comments which minion
belong to which customer etc.

This is just a sample implementation what a keystore-abstraction
could look like.

RedisKeyService - implements the keystore in redis
KeystoreFactory - instantiates Keystore services by config
KeyserviceMixin - mixin-class where key-authentication is needed

This is neither fully implemented nor a fully functional redis-keystore.

Im just curious, if this approach would welcomed at all or not. If so,
i would put more work into it and try to get it into salt.

Any comment is welcome :-)
